#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This snippet runs on linear time O(n). As the size of n increases, it takes one more computation break out of the while loop. Therefore, it's runtime increase proportionally to the number of inputs n.

b) This snippert runs on logarithmic time O(logn). As the size of n increases, the number of computations to break out of the while loop is reduced by halve. It gets to a point where the numbers of inputs doesn't have much effect on the runtime.

c)

## Exercise II
